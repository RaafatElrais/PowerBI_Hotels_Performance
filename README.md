‚ö° Power BI ‚Äì Hotel Project with Power BI

---

üìò Project Overview

This is a multi-page Power BI dashboard built on a cleaned dataset of ~119K customer bookings (cleaned & preprocessed in Python).
The dashboard turns raw hospitality booking data into a decision-grade analytics product that answers business questions across bookings, customers, hotels, and revenue loss. It is built for executive overviews and analyst deep dives with clear navigation: Overview ‚Üí Hotel ‚Üí Customer ‚Üí Revenue ‚Üí Drill Through.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Business Challenge

- Hotel operations and commercial teams lacked a single view to answer:

- Where are bookings and revenue coming from (by country, segment, hotel type)?

- Which customer segments drive the most cancellations or lost revenue?

- How to quantify lost revenue and prioritize actions to recover revenue and improve occupancy?

- Without a unified dashboard, stakeholders struggled to align pricing, distribution, and retention actions.

---

### üí° Approach

- Data cleaning & ETL: cleaned 119K customer records in Python (deduplication, date parsing, missing value handling, standardizing categories).

- Data modeling: built a star-like model inside Power BI linking bookings, customers, hotel metadata, and revenue details.

- DAX & KPIs: created robust DAX measures for occupancy, cancellation rate, ADR, lost revenue, repeat-guest counts, and segment revenue.

- UX & navigation: designed a 4+ page experience with consistent KPI strip, filters (Hotel / Year), and drill-through for detail investigations.

- Visual design: custom theming and card-style KPI blocks for instant executive readability.

### üñºÔ∏è Dashboard Pages & Key Visuals

- Overview (Overview screenshot) ‚Äî Executive KPIs & trend lines:

- Total Booking, Total Revenue, Agents / Companies, Occupancy Rate, Cancellation Rate.

- Trend: bookings by year and top revenue countries.

- Hotel (Hotel page screenshot) ‚Äî Hotel-level KPIs:

- City vs Resort bookings & occupancy, reservation status, booking by room type, occupancy by hotel.

- Customer (Customer page screenshot) ‚Äî Customer behavior:

- Reserved vs canceled bookings, repeated guest counts, top booking countries, occupancy by customer type.

- Revenue (Revenue page screenshot) ‚Äî Revenue & lost revenue analytics:

- Actual Revenue vs Lost Revenue over time, ADR (Average Daily Revenue), revenue by customer type & hotel.

- Drill Through ‚Äî Detail-level investigation for single booking, customer, or hotel.

### üìà Key Insights (what the dashboard revealed)

- High cancellation rate (37%) ‚Äî cancellations represent a material part of lost revenue.

- Substantial lost revenue (16.73M) ‚Äî a large share of potential revenue never realized due to cancellations, no-shows, and booking mismatches.

- Portugal (PRT) leads both bookings and revenue ‚Äî strong market concentration that requires distribution & pricing focus.

- City hotels have more bookings but lower occupancy compared to resorts ‚Äî opportunity to improve conversion/upsell in city properties.

- Online TA & OTAs dominate booking volume ‚Äî distribution costs and cancellation profiles from these channels must be optimized.

- Repeat guests are low (3.8K) relative to base ‚Äî retention tactics could significantly raise lifetime value.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems Identified

- Overreliance on a few countries and distribution channels increases commercial risk.

- Cancellation patterns are creating a major revenue leakage.

- Low repeat-customer ratio indicates weak loyalty/retention mechanics.

- City properties show lower occupancy despite larger booking volume ‚Äî pricing or channel mismatch likely.

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Implement stricter cancellation policies or refundable deposit tiers for high-risk channels to reduce lost revenue.

- Target retention programs for guest segments with higher ADR (e.g., loyalty discounts, targeted follow-ups for repeat opportunities).

- Focus pricing & promotions by market (PRT and GBR are high-value markets) to optimize RevPAR.

- Channel optimization: negotiate with top OTAs to improve cancellation terms or promote non-refundable rates.

- A/B test deposit & refund rules for online TA bookings to measure impact on cancellations and occupancy.

- Build an early-warning lost revenue dashboard (alerts for sudden cancellation spikes by channel/hotel).

---

### üß∞ Tools & Techniques Used

- Python ‚Äî data cleaning, deduplication, parsing dates, mapping categories (source of the 119K cleaned dataset).

- Power Query (Power BI) ‚Äî ETL & lightweight transformations inside the data model.

- Power BI ‚Äî modeling, DAX measures, page navigation, visuals, and report theming.

- DAX measures (examples):

1. TotalBookings = COUNTROWS(Bookings)

2. CancellationRate = DIVIDE([CancelledBookings], [TotalBookings])

3. OccupancyRate = DIVIDE([OccupiedRooms], [AvailableRooms])

4. ADR = DIVIDE([ActualRevenue], [TotalRoomNights])

5. LostRevenue = [PotentialRevenue] - [ActualRevenue]

Design ‚Äî custom theming, KPI cards, and drill-through navigation for analyst workflows.
